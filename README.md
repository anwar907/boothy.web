# boothy.web

@droidconSG not so mini hackathon project....

Booth.y is an instant app project for show cases of Instant app on Lombok Developer community meetup on July 28th 2019. 

This Booth.y consist 2 apps:

1. web app build on flutter web with firebase firestore database.

2. Mobile app --> with single module for both instant app and base module.

The main idea of this apps is to create a simplest way to fill registration form in an exhibitions (Pameran - ID) which having multiple booths.

On every booths, the organizer need to put the QR Code for attendace to scan it and open the Booth.y instant app without actually installing the apps.

Since the apps size is really small (below 3MB) and the last value or user specific values is saved locally in shared preferences, users can easily fill up attendace form without rewriting it again.
